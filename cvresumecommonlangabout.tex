\rheader{About Me} 
{\bf I exploit the unity of mathematics to obtain concrete results.}

I am keenly interested in combining the full power of modern technology, machine learning, and mathematical modeling to understand our world, for fun and profit.

In pure mathematics, I am interested in the structure of absolute Galois groups, spaces whose geometry is determined by their $\pi_1$'s, and algebraic and arithmetic geometry of all sorts, with an eye towards making rigidity theorems explicit and applicable to answer foundational questions in algebraic, arithmetic, and differential geometry.

I learn deeply and quickly, and I consider effective communication an important part of all I do.

My website on {\tt github} hosts my publicly available projects and updated vit\ae\ and r\'esum\'e, and enjoys frequent updates.

Please feel free to contact me with questions, commissions, job offers, and requests.
